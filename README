NAME
    Perinci::Examples::Bin - Perinci example scripts (using
    Perinci::CmdLine)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.05 of Perinci::Examples::Bin (from
    Perl distribution Perinci-Examples-Bin), released on 2014-11-20.

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains example scripts in "bin/" which use
    Perinci::CmdLine. It was split from Perinci::Examples so the latter does
    not need to depend on Perinci::CmdLine.
